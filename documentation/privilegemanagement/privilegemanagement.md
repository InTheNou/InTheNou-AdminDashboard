### Expected Behaviour
The privilege management component is used  in the moderators and event creators component, to create the view of each component passing as progs the string of the view type, 'eventcreators' or 'moderators'. In the moderator view, a user, in this case an administrator, is able to see their delegated users events' and delegated users' and also the events of their delegated users. In the event creator view a moderator or administrator user is seeing their delegated event creator users and their created events if the even button is pressed.
