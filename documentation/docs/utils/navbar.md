# Navbar.vue
## Component Information
### Component view
![Navbar component view](/docs/dashboard/Navbar.PNG)
### Expected Behaviour
The navigation bar is used to navigate to the different views of the system. The administrator bar differs from a moderator bar in that the moderator can not access the moderator list and the tags management components. It also contains the search component and the logout components.
